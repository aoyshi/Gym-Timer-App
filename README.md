A soft alarm bell rings twice when timer is done, and a count-up timer starts up to notify how much time has elapsed since starting the timer until the Go-Back button is pressed:

# Future Work:

1. Integrate multiple screen size support
2. Secure app with ProGuard
3. Design test-cases
4. Allow user to customize 3 things - color of the 4 boxes, time intervals specified within each box, soundtrack that is played upon timer completion.
